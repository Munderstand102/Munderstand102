### Hi, I'm Stefan - aka [Munderstand][website] ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate software enthusiast with a deep interest in reverse engineering and the exploration of software solutions and applications developed by various companies. My primary focus is to understand how these applications were designed and constructed. I enjoy the challenge of dissecting their inner workings, reverse engineering their logic, and rebuilding everything from the knowledge I gain. This includes parsing, copying, and recovering resources, images, and other critical components.

My goal is to uncover the intricacies of software solutions, be it web, mobile, or desktop applications, and use this knowledge to expand my understanding of software development and engineering.

This is my secondary GitHub account. You can also check out my principal GitHub account: [Munderstand101][principal-github].

I also manage an organization on GitHub called [Clone-Atera][organization-github], where I work on various software-related projects and collaborate with others. Here's our organization logo:
